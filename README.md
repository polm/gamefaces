# Gameface

This is a collection of square headshots extracted from the [Internet Archive Book Images Flickr Stream](https://www.flickr.com/photos/internetarchivebookimages/). Face positions were extracted using the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/).

Notes and limitations:

- All images are 300px square JPEGs; some were upscaled from the original
- Sometimes image quality is not great; you'll probably want to pre-process them before use in a game
- No gender information is available
- Due to the nature of the corpus, most photos are of 19th century white men
- Only the first face detected in each picture was used
- Most pictures are photos, but occasionally illustrations or non-faces show up

The Internet Archive books are presumed to be in the Public Domain, and the simple transformation here hopefully doesn't change that.
